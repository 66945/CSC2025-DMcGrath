## Projects

> [!NOTE]
> When I wrote the first fibonnaci program I added functionality to read and write numbers to stdio,
> and as a result I kinda did a few assignments in one (mostly atoi (I also have itoa)).
> Most of the code is the same between Fibonaccis, but the way it is calculated is consistant with the
> assignment requirements

> [!WARNING]
> I didn't add overflow detection to any of the programs except the final project.
